semidemi-js
===========

Implementation of semidemi useragent matcher in javascript.

Purpose: proof of concept replacement for the 'demi' device identification service, that maps from user agent strings to a brand/model device identifier.

Semidemi is to see if we can avoid having to write code to match user agent strings into brand/model identifiers. This project implements a simple markup so that an example user agent string can be used as a more generic matcher. It is still experimental.
